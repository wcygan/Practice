# Scala Practice

[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) stuff

## Build and Run

This project uses [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). 

### To run the tests:

```
$ sbt test
```

As a helpful tip, you can enter the sbt console (`$ sbt`) and continuously run the tests with incremental compilation by running `~test` from within the sbt console:

```
$ sbt
> ~test
```
